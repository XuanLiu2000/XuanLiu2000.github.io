## About Me

Welcome to my website. I'm <strong>Xuan Liu</strong>,&nbsp;
but you can also call me <strong>Lucian</strong> – it's phonetically similar to my Chinese name, <strong>刘璇</strong>.

I'm currently a third-year Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at &nbsp;
[Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/)(<b>XJTU</b>),&nbsp;
advised by Prof. [Jinglong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wEGyDvkAAAAJ).&nbsp;
Prior to this, I completed my B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from XJTU and a jointly-awarded second B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from CAS in 2021.

My focus is on utilizing mathematical and computational tools to improve machines throughout their lifecycle, from design and production to long-term reliability. The recent advancements in generative AI have strengthened my belief in its potential applications in engineering. I’m excited to be part of this rapidly evolving field.


<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am currently seeking Fall'24 PhD positions in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, or any interdisciplinary fields. If you have any openings or opportunities aligning with my expertise, please don't hesitate to reach out. </strong></strong>
