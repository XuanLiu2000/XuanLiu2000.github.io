## About Me

Welcome to my website. I'm <strong>Xuan Liu</strong>,&nbsp;
but you can also call me <strong>Lucian</strong> – it's phonetically similar to my Chinese name, <strong>刘璇</strong>.

I'm currently a third-year Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at &nbsp;
[Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/)(<b>XJTU</b>),&nbsp;
advised by Prof. [Jinglong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wEGyDvkAAAAJ).&nbsp;
Prior to this, I completed my B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from XJTU and a jointly-awarded second B.E. degree in Computer Science from CAS in 2021.

My focus is on using mathematical and computational tools (e.g. AI) to improve machines from design, produce to full-life cycle guarantee. Recent advances in generative AI make me firmly believe in the potential application of AI in Engineering.  I'm excited to be a part of this rapidly evolving field.


<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am currently seeking Fall'24 PhD positions in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, or any interdisciplinary fields. If you have any openings or opportunities aligning with my expertise, please don't hesitate to reach out. </strong></strong>
