## About Me

Welcome to my website. My name is <strong>Xuan Liu</strong>,&nbsp;
but you can also call me <strong>Lucian</strong> – it's phonetically similar to my Chinese name, <strong>刘璇</strong>.

I'm currently a third-year Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at &nbsp;
[Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/)(<b>XJTU</b>),&nbsp;
advised by Prof. [Jinglong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wEGyDvkAAAAJ).&nbsp;
Prior to this, I obtained my B.E. in Mechanical Engineering and a second B.E. degree in Computer Science in 2021.

My focus is on utilizing mathematical and computational tools to improve machines throughout their lifecycle, from design and production to long-term reliability. The recent advancements in generative AI have strengthened my belief in its potential applications in engineering. I’m excited to be part of this rapidly evolving field.


<strong style="color:#861F41; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#861F41; font-weight:600">I will join the ISE Department of Virginia Tech as PhD student. If you want to collaborate or talk with me, please feel free to reach out. </strong></strong>
